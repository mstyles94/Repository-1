# Topology
For this assignment I chose a wired mesh topology. I chose this topology due to its reliability and ability to stay connected if any of the devices on the network go down or there is a break in the connection. This diagram includes 2 computers, a router, and a printer.

# SQL Query
For this assignment I used basic SQL statements to display the needed data table, then used a where statement to narrow down the list to show only quantities greater than 20. I then used an Order by keyword to sort them in ascending order.
